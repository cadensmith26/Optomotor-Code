# Optomotor-Code

3 Files are here:

1) "FindIRCodes" is to help you find the HEX codes of the buttons on your IR remote. Use the codes given in the serial monitor and input them in the format 0xHEXCODE.
2) "FlickerFusion" is a used to control the speed of a motor by pressing buttons on a remote. I have mine so that a push of the up arrow will increase the speed of motor by 1rpm each time it is pressed. It can be decreased by 1 RPM using the down arrow. RPM is shown
in the serial monitor.
3) "VisualAcuity" also has RPM speed controls but is less simple. This code is used to spin the optomotor drum around the animal at a constant speed.

Please read the codes and if something is still unclear, reach out to me at caden.d.smith-1@ou.edu
